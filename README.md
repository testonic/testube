# TESTUBE 
## Stage 0 Testonic.

This project is a fork of the [VoxelGame](https://github.com/Zylann/voxelgame) demo, specifically 'Blocky_Game' therein. 
Our goal is to widen it out from a techdemo to a more general-purpose "game", including a full mod-api. 
This will be done over most if not all of 2025, as [the maintainer](https://github.com/parencompany/) learns Godot / more about gamedev in-general. ie: Keep expectations 'low enough' and note this has built-in planned opulence and it will be deprecated "eventually" as Testonic proper, manifests. I'll write more about those plans / goals under a (loose) roadmap, [here]().

### Dependencies
This project uses the C++ module:
- [Voxel](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel)

Fyi, we plan to ship builds, and a launcher to sync releases but that might come in as-late as like Spring 2025.

### And A Special Thanks
To [Zylann!](https://github.com/zylann) Without them, zero way this or the rest of Testonic would of happened! </br> If you can, [throw them a few bucks](https://github.com/sponsors/Zylann) for continued work on [Godot_Voxel](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel).
